# LEGO-Eval: Towards Fine-Grained Evaluation on Synthesizing 3D Embodied Environments with Tool Augmentation
LEGO-Eval is a **tool-augmented evaluation framework** for text-guided 3D scene synthesis. It enables fine-grained and interpretable assessment of instruction-scene alignment by grounding scene components using a diverse suite of 21 multimodal tools, supporting multi-hop reasoning over spatial and attribute constraints.

## Overview
Recently, there has been notable progress in text-guided 3D scene synthesis using large language models (LLMs). However, evaluating the alignment between textual instructions and the resulting 3D scenes remains a challenging problem, as existing approaches often lack a deep understanding of 3D spatial structures, limiting their reliability. To address this limitation, we introduce:

- **LEGO-Eval**: An evaluation framework that uses diverse tools to explicitly ground scene elements and assess instruction-scene alignment.
- **LEGO-Bench**: A benchmark for text-guided 3D scene synthesis, featuring fine-grained instructions that describe complex spatial layouts and object attributes in real-world scenes.
